# Dictionary approach for Nested NER

> CODALAB SCORE: 0.42

## Description

The [`dict.ipynb`](dict.ipynb) notebook uses a simple dictionary-based model. It uses a dictionary to store the entities and their corresponding labels. Each token for the dictionary is stemmed, if the token is a list of words, then each word is stemmed and then joined.

The dictionary is then used to predict the labels for the test data. Candidates for the checking are generated by n-grams. Each n-gram is processed in the same way as the training data. The n-grams are then checked against the dictionary to predict the labels.

## How to run

1. Install the required libraries if needed.
1. Run the notebook [`dict.ipynb`](dict.ipynb) in the Jupyter environment.
